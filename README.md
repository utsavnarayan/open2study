Assignment from SlideRule

TASK 1: Work on a simple crawler that takes Open2Study.com course URLs and extracts important information like course name, instructor, syllabus etc. These details should be stored in a relational database.

TASK 2: Create a simple Django admin interface and a 'user' interface that allows users to look at course details (if they know the URL). The user interface can show a couple of pages:

Page 1: A list of crawled URLs. This page should have links to a detail page for each URL and a link that takes users directly to the course page.

Page 2 (detail page) - should show details that have been crawled.
